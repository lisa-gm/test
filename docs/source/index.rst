Welcome to the SQUIC documentation!
===================================

**SQUIC** is a second-order, L1-regularized maximum likelihood method for performant large-scale sparse precision matrix estimation. The presented source code is the SQUIC shared library (libSQUIC) intended for Linux and Mac OS.

The different packages for SQUIC can be found `here <https://www.gitlab.ci.inf.usi.ch/SQUIC>`_.

Check out the :doc:`documentation` for further information, as well as the :ref:`installation` of the project.

.. note::

   For all note interface packages, libSQUIC is required. Precompiled versions of libSQUIC for Mac and Linux are available and are ready to use.
